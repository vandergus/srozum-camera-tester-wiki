When it comes to choosing the enclosure for the project, front panel design, furniture, etc., the finished product could be very different in terms of usability and final cost.

The Tester can be packed in a tiny box and powered by a 9V battery, thus making it a mobile device. While most people want a compact mobile solution to test cameras in the field, someone prefers bench-style setups more suitable for everyday use during camera repairs.

The product shown in the photos is a result of me going through different designs, looking for enclosures available on a market, and building a tool for my needs.

If you would like to build similar setup for yourself or already own a Film Camera Tester Kit, here is some helpfull information.

Templates with all dimmensions needed to drill holes and cutouts for LCD screen and Keypads you can find [here](https://github.com/srozum/film_camera_tester/tree/master/assets/templates)

Enclosure, used in my project, could be found on Amazon, AliExpres, etc. under different brands like "YaeCCC", "Zulkit", "Fielect" and many others. Just search for "electronic enclosures blue metal project box"
