Camera Tester uses Arduino Nano compatible board for processing. Arduino mounted on Shield PCB which connects all periferal devices to it through three sockets. Each socket has pin for automatic device identification. Device identification is based on simple resistor divider which present in each sensor or light unit. Such approach allows to make user interface much simpler.

Controls are mounted on Keypad PCB, and include Rotary Encoder, and "Mode", "Menu", "Start" and "Stop" buttons. Dedicated "Start" and "Stop" buttons are used to avoid using interrupts and increase accuracy of measurements. Thus, during the test, all other controls are disabled. Keypad itself was designed in two form factors (further named as "vertical" and "horizontal") for convenience of mounting testers in various enclosures.

For time based measurements you don't need a specialized light source, neither precise alighnment, etc. Best choice of light source would be a standard desk lamp with incadescent light bulb, or bright LED panel placed in front of a camera in proximity of 5-15cm. But, keep in mind, that photodiodes used for the Sensors are most sensible to red to infrared light. Thus some bright white cheap LEDs (with color temp 6500K and poor CRI) won't work, because their spectrum lies mostly in blue range.

### Sockets


**Socket A** is a main socket for connecting Sensors which are used for time based measurements. It uses 3 GPIO pins either as inputs or outputs, depending on connected Sensor. Currently, sensors #1, #2, #3 can be connected to this socket and will be recognized by a Tester.

**Socket B** is a secondary socket which has 1 GPIO pin and other two pins are I2C bus pins. Currently, only sensor #7 can be used on this socket.

> In current revision I2C pins directly connected to Socket B without a buffer. Thus, if you accidentally connect wrong Sensor to Socket B it may cause a damage to MCU.

**Light Unit Socket** is used to control Light Unit. One pin is used to turn on or off or regulate brightness of a light source with PWM signal, depending on type on connected Light Unit. Other pin is used to turn on or of the Fan of a Light Unit.

> Unlike Socket A or B you cannot hot-swap Light Units. Light Unit must be connected before powering the Tester.

> Do not connect LED or any other load to Light Unit Socket pins. It's pins should be used as a control signals only.



### Sensors

**Sensor #1** - sensor with three diagonally placed photodiodes, for testing focal plane shutters. Such construction is commonly used in professional testers and allows to use it without worrying about the right sensor orientation. It's frame edge designed to snuggly fit in a frame opening of most cameras without touching the curtains.

> This sensor was made in two versions: V1 with 32mmx22mm distance between furthest photodiodes, V2 with 32mmx20mm distance.

**Sensor #2** - sensor with single photodiode at the center, for older cameras with simple shutters. It's frame edge is made smaller to fit older cameras, since those may have either smaller frame opening, or sprockets or some pins protruding, which will not allow you to fit bigger sensor. Also this sensor comes with an adpater for easy placement in frame opening of a medium format 6x6 or 6x45 cameras.

**Sensor #3** - sensor with single photodiode and a laser diode mounted against it, the construction you can see in other implementations of Arduino based testers. This sensor is comfortable to use when you need to test simple shutter detached from a camera. Also this sensor is required for "Leaf Efficiency" mode.

**Sensor #7** - simple sensor with standard PC connector used to test flash sync or delay timings of a cameres with simple or focal plane shutters. Instead of PC connector you may use hot shoe connector.


Schematics of each Sensor you can find on "Assembly Instructions" page.

More IDs (like #4, #5, #6, etc.) are reserved for future development of sensors for medium format focal plane shutters, leica type cameras with non removable preasure plate, and others.


### Light Units

**Light Unit #1** - simple ON/OFF light unit. Added just for the convinience of use, Tester can turn on or off the light source when you press "Start" or "Stop" when running tests.

**Light Unit #2** - light unit with adjustable brightness. Controlled with PWM signal generated by a Tester.

> Schematics will be available later

### Power supply

You have few options how to power the device:
- From a 7..12V regulated or unregulated power source. Power will be regulated down to 5V by a voltage regulator of Arduino board.
- From a 5V regulated power source. Connector for a power supply wires in such case should be soldered to pins labeled as "5V"
- Via USB cable connected directly to Arduino board.
- Also, there is a reserved space and connections for small voltage regulator, in case if you chose to power device with 24V or else.

> **Allways double check the polarity of connected power source before powering the device. Device is not equiped with any protection against reversed polarity.**
