Firmvare version 2.3

- Measures exposure time at the center of a frame of simple (leaf) and focal plane shutters of 35mm and Medium Format (6x6 or 6x45 using adapter) cameras.
- Measures timings of focal plane shutters with cutrains traveling vertically or horizontally.
  - Results can be represented in few different ways to help you detect different flaws in a shutter operation, such as curtains capping or tapering, uneven travel speed, etc.
- Measures delays between flash contact and shutter opening.
  - Automatically identifies X, M or FP modes.
- Takes series of measurements, and calculates average stats.
  - Number of tests in series can be selected in Settings menu between 3, 5, 10 or 20.
- Automatically detects type of connected Sensors, and notifies you if wrong sensor connected for a specific Mode.
- Automatically detects target speed used to calculate the error.
  - Target speed can be set to "Auto" or pre-set from a list of standard speeds.
  - You aslo can select between two sets of standard speeds (Old style like 1/50 or New style like 1/60), depending on type of shutter you are testing.
- Automatically re-calculates curtains travel time according to selected frame width or height.
- Range of measured speeds from 1s to 1/8000
- Accuracy 10Âµs (measured in pre-set environment, using signal generator and specialized light source)
  - Accuracy may vary during real life measurements with different light sources and cameras.
